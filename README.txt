CompositeType for Cassandra

For a more detailed description of how this might be use, please read:

Although Cassandra provides SuperColumns which allow you to have columns
containing columns, it's often desirable to use regular columns and to
be able to combine two or more ids into a sortable column name.  This
is especially important for building inverted indexes for searches or
being able to do things like creating a table to map user names sorted
by last name then first name to user ids.

This can accomplished by concatenating two ids together with a separator,
such as "last.first.randomuuid", and assuming that each id is properly
passed and compares correctly via bytewise comparison, this approach might
work.  But, if the ids are numerical or time-based UUIDs for example, the
results are usually less than satisfactory.

CompositeType is a comparer that allows you to combine the existing
Cassandra types into a composite type that will then be compared correctly
for each of the component types.

To use this, you must specify the comparer in your storage-conf.xml file:

<ColumnFamily CompareWith="compositecomparer.CompositeType" Name="Stuff"/>

To construct a composite name for a new column, use the following:

Composite c = new Composite();
c.addUTF8("smith").addUTF8("bob").addLong(System.currentTimeMillis());
byte[] column_name = c.serialize();

A convenience method is provided as well, although it makes certain assumptions
that you might want to very are applicable.  You use it like this:

import static compositecomparer.Composite.serialize;

byte[] cname = serialize("smith", "bob", new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));

If you wanted to find all users with the last name "smith" whose name started
with "b", you could do the following:

byte[] slice_start = serialize("smith", "b");
byte[] slice_end = serialize("smith", "b\uFFFF");

The composite type is encoded as a byte array consisting of a prefix byte and a
version byte followed by each component part.  Each component part starts with
1 byte to specify the component type, and then for variable length types such
as ASCII strings, 2 bytes are used for the length of the string:

In the above example, the following byte array would be produced for the composite
name:

ed 01 05 00 05 73 6d 69 74 68 05 00 03 62 6f 62 01 00 00 01 29 47 2f 24 e0
